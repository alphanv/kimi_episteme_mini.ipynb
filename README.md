# kimi_episteme_mini.ipynb
Been working on a scientific idea with ai agents, this is what KIMI came up with; "Episteme Mini-Loop: 30-line Colab notebook that teaches an AI agent to discover, predict and control a living ecosystem in 3 self-designed experiments. Open-source, planet-ready."

# üß¨ Episteme Mini-Loop  
*‚ÄúDNA is Earth‚Äôs OS. This is the patch that lets us fork it.‚Äù*

---

## What it is
A **single-file, zero-dependency (beyond PyTorch & SciPy) example** of the full Episteme Spacecraft loop:  
1. Observe ecosystem data  
2. Learn latent parameters (`r`, `K`)  
3. Design next intervention for max information gain  
4. Recover a human-readable symbolic law

---

## Quick start
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python episteme_mini.py
```
or open the notebook:  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YOUR_USER/episteme-mini-loop/blob/main/episteme_mini.ipynb)

## 60-second tour
| Step | Output |
|------|--------|
| **Simulate** | Logistic growth time-series with control input |
| **Infer** | Neural posterior over `r`, `K` via SNPE |
| **Design** | Bayesian optimal experiment picks next control value |
| **Recover** | Least-squares fit returns symbolic logistic equation |
